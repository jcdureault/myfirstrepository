## Hello World. This is my first repository

Here is some text. You can type anything here you would like. 

Next, I want to show you how to create a link. Let's make a link to [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/).

Things I like to do in Berkeley:

* Stay safe during quarantine
* Cook tasty meals
* Study hard for J-Rue's class

My plans for the weekend are:

1. Complete all of the assignments for J-Rue's class
2. Double-check that I completed all of J-Rue's assignments.
3. Triple-check that all assignments are done.
